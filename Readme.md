# Setup Professional Backend

* we temporarily store images/audio in our store and also on 3rd party service like cloudinary/aws, to prevent data loss in case 3rd party service is down
* we create temp folder , add .gitkeep empty file to push empty folder to github
* use [this website](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/#Node) to generate giignore file
* install nodemon which automatically restarts server when file changes
* install it as dev dependancy so `npm i -D nodemon`
* install prettier for avoiding merge conflicts when working in a team and format the document properly, instal it as dev dependacy
* `.prettierrc` - has rules related to pretifying of a file and `prettierignore` - must include files where prettier should not be there
